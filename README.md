# Introduction
Welcome to webQR by Viprus. This repo contains the source behind our web app that handles WiFi QR code generation on iOS. Users can visit https://qr.viprus.co.uk to securely and quickly setup a printable QR code for their WiFi network. This can then be printed on a Viprus A4 sticker sheet and stuck on the Viprus Link.

# Source
webQR was built on <a href="https://github.com/qifi">Qifi</a>. QR code generation takes place on locally executed Javascript to ensure that the user's SSID and password are not transmitted over the network and exposed to any hosting servers.
